## Guidelines for contributing

* Keep all parameters easily tweakable

* Comment heavily, comment often.

* Hot swaps: Keep the api of all agents and games exactly the same so you can hot swap one algorithm for another.

* Not more than 100 lines of code in one place

* Try to maximize reusability

* Hardcoding is really bad as it makes the code non tweakable. Avoid hardcoding whenever possible.
